    Lyrics
Out of the mist of history
He'll come again
Sailing on ships across the sea
To a wounded Nation
Signs of a savior
Like fire on the water
It's what we prayed for
One of our own
Just wait
Though wide he may roam
Always
A hero comes home
He goes where no one has gone
But always
A hero comes home
Deep in the heart of darkness sparks
A dream of light
Surrounded by hopelessness
He finds the will to fight
There's no surrender
Always remember
It doesn't end here
We're not alone
Just wait
Though wide he may roam
Always
A hero comes home
He goes where no one has gone
But always
A hero comes home
And he will come back on the crimson tide
Dead or alive
And even though we know the bridge has burned
He will return
He will return
Just wait
Though wide he may roam
Always
A hero comes home
He knows of places unknown
Always
A hero comes home
Someday they'll carve in stone
"The hero comes home"
He goes and comes back alone
But always
A hero comes home
Just wait
Though while he may roam
Always
A hero comes home
