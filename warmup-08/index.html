The site will be a pretty standard layout.  Navigation box at the top left, site logo centered at the top beside the site title.  Below that will be the page content combined with or adjacent to any images used that relate to the content.  At the bottom of the page will be a secondary navigation bar, so scrolling back up is unnecessary. Both navigation bars will have an effect when the mouse is hovered above it. The image and page content will have framing to help it stand out more.
