        <h2>Where the name comes from</h2>

    <p> The word ‘IKEA’ is an acronym that celebrates our Swedish heritage. I stands for Ingvar, the first name of the IKEA founder. K is for Kamprad, his last name. E is for Elmtaryd, the name of the farm where Ingvar grew up, and A is for Agunnaryd, the name of the parish in Småland, Ingvar's home village.</p>
<img src="image/ikealogos.jpg">
<p>Our first ever logo was created in 1951. It was round in shape and used the color red. IKEA founder, Ingvar Kamprad, liked the color red because it represents low price. </p>

    The blue and yellow IKEA logo is the symbol for instant recognition of the IKEA Brand. They also enhance our uniqueness and our Swedish heritage. The IKEA Brand blue colour creates attention to the offer, thereby making it stand out. The IKEA Brand yellow, on the other hand, is an optimistic color giving customers a positive impression when meeting the IKEA Brand, everywhere, anytime.
