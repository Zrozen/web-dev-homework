<h1>Karaage (Japanese Fried Chicken)</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1½ lb boneless skinless chicken breast </li>
    <li>½ tsp salt</li>
    <li> black pepper</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (more if necessary)</li>
    <li>4 cups oil (for deep-frying)</li>
</br><!-- Could not get seasoning to not be indented. -->
<b>Seasoning</b>
    <li>½ tsp grated ginger</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    <li>½ Tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>½ Tbsp sake </li>
    <li>½ tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
</br>
<b>For Serving (Optional)</b>
<li>lemon wedges</li>
<li>Kewpie mayonnaise</li>
<li>shichimi togarashi (for a spicy taste)</li>
    

 
  </ul>
  
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
  <li>Cut each chicken thigh into 2-inch pieces and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
  <li>Grate the ginger and mince the garlic</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake, and sesame oil. Whisk it all together.</li>
  <li>Add the chicken to the bowl and mix it with your hands. Cover and keep in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot and heat it to <i>325ºF </i>on medium heat.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, prepare the potato starch and all-purpose flour in separate piles.</li>
  <li>First, lightly dredge each marinated chicken piece in the flour and dust off the excess flour. Then, dredge it in the potato starch and remove the excess starch. </li>
  <li>When the oil temperature has reached <i>325ºF</i>, gently submerge each chicken piece in the oil. Do not overcrowd the pot; <em>add only 3-5 pieces at a time.</em> If you put too many pieces in at once, the oil temperature will drop quickly, and the chicken will end up absorbing too much oil.</li>
  <li><b>First Deep-Frying:</b> Deep-fry for 90 seconds, or until the outside of the chicken is a light golden color. If the chicken browns too quickly, then the oil temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces of chicken in the oil or lower the heat. Controlling the oil temperature at all times is very important for deep-frying. Transfer the chicken pieces to a wire rack to drain the excess oil.</li>
  <li>The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken as it rests on the wire rack. Continue deep-frying the remaining chicken pieces. Between batches, pick up and discard the crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh sieve. This keeps the oil clean and prevents it from becoming darker.</li>
  <li><b>Second Deep-Frying:</b> Now, heat the oil to <i>350ºF</i>. Place 3 to 5 pieces of the resting chicken back into the oil and deep-fry for 45 seconds, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Transfer them to a wire rack to drain the excess oil. Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.
    </li>
